# Image Based Calorie Calculator

This is a group project implemented by Myself, Anirudh Mundra and Shubham Munot.

Considering “How many calories am I consuming in my meal?” as the real world
problem, we have proposed a methodology “Image Based Calorie Calculator” of calculating
the calories of the ingredients of your meal. Ingredients are the whole food items you will be
using to prepare the meal.

Having clicked an image of all these ingredients, with the help of image processing concepts
we will be able to provide you with an approximate calorie value. The user can now gauge
whether his meal is fit for him or changes are required. Image having several ingredients will
go through the segmentation process initially, to isolate every object. Followed by feature
extraction methodology to identify each item, calories would be calculated by using a
predefined nutrition table.
